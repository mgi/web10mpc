4. Description

4.1 Sort artists by "ArtistSort" tag (experimental)

Setting USE_ARTISTSORT_TAG to TRUE in Config.php will sort artists like this:
Pearl Jam --> Tom Petty --> Pink Floyd --> The Police --> Porcupine Tree. Please
note the following before you enable this:

- Add "ArtistSort" tags to all songs. Create a consistent mapping, i.e. avoid
  something like this:
           Artist                    ArtistSort
  Song 1:  Bob Marley & The Wailers  Marley, Bob & The Wailers
  Song 2:  Bob Marley & The Wailers  Marley, Bob & Wailers, The
  This does not make sense, and Web1.0MPC will throw an MpdDatabaseException.
- MPD must read the "artistsort" tag, by default it does not. Add it to the line
  starting with "metadata_to_use" in your mpd.conf file.
- Restart MPD.
- Update the MPD database.
- Web1.0MPC will scan the complete database to create the mapping of artist
  names to sort keys. This may take some time (~3.9s on an Atom N270 @ 1600 MHz
  for a database with ~650 artists and ~10,400 songs, MPD and Web1.0MPC running
  on the same machine (no network transfer)). It will do this only once and
  cache the results in a file. The cache file will be deleted (and recreated on
  the next request) when you press "Update database" on "Setup" page.


5. Requirements

Development system:

- Debian Jessie
- MPD 0.19.1
- lighttpd 1.4.35
- PHP 5.6.2 with php5-cgi and php5-gd

Might work with less, but not tested.


6. Installation

- extract the files to a directory on your webserver
- edit ./class/Web10Mpc/Config.php
- check and adjust file and directory permissions, the ./cache directory needs
  to be writable by the webserver


7. History

TODO.
